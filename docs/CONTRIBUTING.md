### Contributing Code

#### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wallet-qr-bundle.git
   cd wallet-qr-bundle
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # With Docker (recommended)
   make install
   
   # Without Docker
   composer install
   ```

#### Code Standards

The project follows these standards:

- **PSR-12**: PHP code style
- **PHP 8.1+**: Modern PHP features
- **Strict type hints**: `declare(strict_types=1);` in all files
- **PHP-CS-Fixer**: Used to maintain code consistency

**Before committing**:

```bash
# Check code style
make cs-check
# or
composer cs-check

# Fix code style automatically
make cs-fix
# or
composer cs-fix
```

#### Tests

**The project requires 100% code coverage**. All tests must pass before merging. New features should include tests.

```bash
# Run all tests
make test
# or
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
# or
composer test-coverage

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

**Test structure**:
- Tests should be in the `tests/` directory
- Each class should have its corresponding test
- Tests should be descriptive and cover edge cases
- Use mocks when appropriate
- **All code must have 100% coverage** - new features must include comprehensive tests

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/my-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Add tests for new features
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Run `make qa` to verify everything

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of feature"
